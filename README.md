# simple-shop

This project is aimed to be a small coding excercise implementing
a simple shop front with products, categories 
and a simple cart integration whilst showing the coding ability.

Finished all-in-one solutions like Django-Oscar or Cartridge for Mezzanine
have been avoided on purpose although they would have covered everything and
beyond.
